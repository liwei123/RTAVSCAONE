## Usage
There are 2 parts to our assignment.
## Part 1: MRCNN
### 1. Open MRCNN_CA1.ipynb in Google Colab
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. **```File```** > **```Upload notebook...```** > **```GitHub```** > **```Paste this link:``` https://github.com/liwei123/RTAVSCAONE/blob/master/MRCNN_CA1.ipynb**
3. Ensure that **```Runtime```** > **```Change runtime type```** is ```Python 3``` with ```GPU```
### 2. Initial imports, install, initializations
Second step is to clone required files and dependencies. Select the first code cell and push ```shift+enter```. You'll see running lines of executing code. Wait until it's done (1-2 minutes).
### 3. Run on keras 2.2.5 and tensorflow 1.x
Third step is to run the second cell and then restart your runtime. Check that you are running tensorflow version 1.15.2 in cell four and that your keras version is 2.2.5 in cell 5.
### 4. Proceed on and run the code 

## Part 2: Deceptron2
### 1. Open detectron2_v2.ipynb in Google Colab
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. **```File```** > **```Upload notebook...```** > **```GitHub```** > **```Paste this link:``` https://github.com/liwei123/RTAVSCAONE/blob/master/detectron2_v2.ipynb**
3. Ensure that **```Runtime```** > **```Change runtime type```** is ```Python 3``` with ```GPU```
### 2. Initial imports, install, initializations
Second step is to clone required files and dependencies. Select and run the first four code cell and push ```shift+enter```. You'll see running lines of executing code. Wait until it's done (1-2 minutes).
### 3. Proceed on and run the code
